## 1980s-1990s: Commercializaiton and plasma sources

<!-- Early ICP, very first laser ablation in 1980s -->

Houk et al. (1980) and Date & Gray (1981) developed inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Gray (1985), coupled ICP-MS with laser ablation (LA) systems (as a sample introduction). Soon after their development ICP-MS (in 1983) and ICP-MS coupled with LA (1990's) became comercially avaialble and experienced great improvements, which made them a dominant the inorganic mass spectrometric techniques for trace, ultratrace and isotope analysis (e.g., ).
