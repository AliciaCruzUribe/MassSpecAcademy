## 1890s-1920s: Early developments {#sec-EarlyHistory}
### Cathode ray tubes
In the 1890's scientists worked to understand atomic structure. This exploration eventually lead to the discovery of cathode rays specifically to determine mass, which we now call electrons. In probing cathode rays he deflected them magnetically or electrically, and then compared the heat generated when they hit a thermal junction. The deflection allowed him to calculate mass and the heat generation allowed him to calculate energy. By discovering these subatomic electrically charged particles he won the nobel prize for this in 1906

JJ Thomson continued this work with his research assistant FW Aston. They would deflect accelerated gases using a magnetic and electric field and measure that deflection using a photographic plate in the path of the ion beam (@fig-history-neon). The physical dispersion was measured and due to the presence of two dispersion paths the two stable isotopes of neon were discovered in 1912, the first time stable isotopes were measured. The glass apparatus that the subatomic particles were accelerated through is a cathode ray tube, and is a predecessor to the modern day mass spectrometer. Aston continued the work combining magnetic and electronic separation increasing the mass resolving power of the instruments .

### Electron impact sources
Alternatively, in 1917 AJ Dempster published a work on positive rays largely considered to be the first description of an electron ionization source [@Dempster_1918]. He directed a positively charged beam at a solid surface generating ions he could determine a mass to charge ratio. He continued this work and eventually determined the stable isotopes of lithium and magnesium using this technique. Furthering the techniques developed by Dempster, W Bleakly was able to generate a monoenergetic beam of electrons to ionize gases in 1929 [@Bleakney_1929]. The beam in this type of instrument traversed a 180 $^\circ$ magnetic field and was deflected in a circle to the detector.

## 1930s: The first mass spectrometers {#sec-FirstSpecs}
Due to the size and complexity of the 180 $^\circ$ magnetic field early spectrometers, they were difficult to build and maintain making them a relatively rare tool. In 1940 A Nier developed a mass spectrometer in which the ion source and the detectors were removed from the influence of the 60 $^\circ$ magnet. These sector field mass spectrometers greatly reduced the power consumption of the instruments, decreased complexity, and did not decrease the mass resolving power. With the knowledge that was gained during the war expansion, he published his seminal paper in 1947, describing the basis of most mass spectrometers that are still used today [@Nier_1947]. The Nier-Johnson or double focusing mass spectrometer combined the sector magnet with an energy filter allowing for pure separation by mass, a design that is still the norm for high mass resolution instruments.

## 1940s-1950s: The Manhattan Project and World War II

<!-- H Urey, W Paul, Calutrons, growth of isotope geochemistry, first TOF in late 40s -->

World War II greatly accelerated the pace of scientific development in physics and chemistry as world powers competed to develop new weapons, production techniques, and energy sources. While international collaboration and public dissemination of research ground to a halt during the war years, scientists continued working in secret on much of the same basic research---alongside a focus on applications to wartime policy goals, particularly nuclear weapons development. During the war, massive industrial operations like the Manhattan Project focused on isotope separation technology and the physics of nuclear decay and chain reactions. After the war, many of the scientists who worked on these projects returned to basic research, publishing a wave of new publications based on previously secret wartime research. These developments in the late 1940s and 1950s laid the groundwork for the modern field of isotope geochemistry by bringing the tools of nuclear war to bear on chronology and chemical processes in the geosciences.

### The Manhattan Project

Nuclear weapons require a sufficient mass of concentrated fissile material (known as a *critical mass*) to maintain a nuclear chain reaction. Obtaining a critical mass involves mining and chemical separation of uranium and subsequent isotope enrichment to obtain an enrichment of at least 20\% uranium-235 (usually much higher).

#### The Urey Equation

The basis for modern stable isotope geochemistry can be found in the Urey–Bigeleisen–Mayer equation (frequently referred to simply as the Urey Equation), which describes the equilibrium isotope fractionation that occurs during isotope exchange reactions. The relationship was published by Urey in 1945 and then by Bigeleisen and Mayer in a more accessible form in 1947. In that publication, they also acknowledged that an equivalent relationship was published by German physicist Ludwig Waldmann in 1943 based on simultaneous secret work conducted as part of the isotope separation efforts of the German nuclear program.

$$
\alpha = \prod_{i=1}^{3N-6} \left( \frac{u_i^*}{u_i} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-u_i}}{1 - e^{-u_i^*}} \right)
$$

## Where:

* $\alpha$ is the equilibrium isotope fractionation factor.
* $u_i = \frac{h \nu_i}{k T}$ is the dimensionless vibrational frequency of the light isotopologue.
* $u_i^* = \frac{h \nu_i^*}{k T}$ is the dimensionless vibrational frequency of the heavy isotopologue.
* $h$ is Planck's constant.
* $\nu_i$ and $\nu_i^*$ are the vibrational frequencies (in Hz) of the $i$-th normal mode for the light and heavy isotopologues, respectively.
* $k$ is Boltzmann's constant.
* $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.
* The product is taken over all vibrational modes: $3N - 6$ for nonlinear molecules, or $3N - 5$ for linear molecules, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the molecule.

While this equation may look complicated, it is actually a simplified model that allows scientists to calculate the equilibrium fraction of isotopes at different temperatures. Its application allows small differences in isotope ratio to be interpreted as indicators of different physical conditions during the formation or modification of different geological materials.
