# Mass Spectrometer Components

General outline of a mass spectrometer

Diagram with parts labeled. Ion optics will point to several different pieces.

MALDI
Laser desorption
RIMS

## Analyzers

### Magnetic sectors

### Electrostatic analyzers

### Quadrupoles

Quadrupole mass analyzers filter ions by generating an electric field through which only ions of certain mass to charge ratios are able to pass. As shown in the figure - need fig - , ions enter the quadrupole along it's z-axis. Those with m/z within the selected range will maintain a stable trajectoy along the z-axis and reach spectormeter's the detector. Ions with m/z outside the selcted range will be destabilized by the applied electric fields and prevented from passing through the analyzer. 

**How does it work?**
Quadrupole mass analyzers use four charged rods ("poles") connected diagonally in pairs. One pair 
-  generation of e-field using RF and DC potetial
-       low pass filter and high pass filter

**Tuning (basic...is this called tuning?)**
-  impact of changing RF and DC 
        higher DC wrt RF means more selcteve filter, less abolute amount of ions/ signal 

**Some Math**
- ex: stability of ion of a single mass 
-       math --> mathieu equation / "stability triangle"
