## Detectors

There are several different types of detectors integrated into mass spectrometers. Three general capabilities of the ideal ion detector include: (1) acceptance of ions, (2) 100% efficiency, or no signal loss, and (3) no bias between detectors during simultaneous collection of multiple ion beams.

Various types of detectors are described below:

### Faraday detector

#### Amplifiers

Capacitive

Resistance-based

### Electron Multipliers and/or Ion Counters

#### Secondary Electron Multipliers

#### Daly Detectors

#### Channeltrons

### Other

AMS Detectors (ion counters with information on energy). Gas ionization detectors.

Array detectors

## Ion optics

### Ion lenses/deflectors

### Using magnets as ion optics

### Retardation lenses

### Zoom/dispersion lenses

## Vacuum Systems

### Low vacuum pumps

Oil pumps
Mercury diffusion pumps
Scroll pumps
