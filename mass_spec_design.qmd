# Mass Spectrometer Components

General outline of a mass spectrometer

Diagram with parts labeled. Ion optics will point to several different pieces.


## Sample introduction system

Sample introduction systems can be organized by the physical form (phase) of the material it handles. Fundamentally different strategies are needed depending on whether the sample is a solid, liquid, or gas. The right introduction system for your specific application could also depend on your analytical goal. For example, you might need to add a tracer to help you quantify amounts of certain analytes, or use exploit chemical or physical processes to remove a problematic contaminant. Here, we'll organize introduction systems to
