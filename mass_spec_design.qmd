### Collision/Reaction cells (CRCs){#sec-design-crc}

The purpose of a collision/reaction cell (CRC) is to use an added gas within the cell to mitigate spectral interferences, either via collision of interferents with gas molecules or reaction of interferents or interferred ions . CRCs are most typically used in conjuction with ICP-source instruments, and are placed before the mass analyzer to filter ions or interferences of interest. 

A CRC is typically housed within an RF multipole (either quadrupole, hexapole, or octopole), which serves to focus the ion beam. Some CRCs also induce an axial electrical field (along the length of the cell) in order to slow ions down or speed them up, depending on the type of reaction. The two primary CRC modes are collision mode and reaction mode. 

In collision mode, an inert gas such as He or H$_2$ is used to collide interferents. One general guiding principle of collisions is that the cross-sectional area of polyatomic ions is generally larger than the analyte of interest. This results in more collisions of polyatomics than single ions with the reaction gas. 

> CID (Collision Induced Dissociation) - Generally, polyatomic ions produced in the plasma collide with neutral gas molucules in the collision cell, resulting in dissociation of the polyatomics. 

> KED (Kinetic Energy Descrimination) - Collisions occur between an ion and the collision cell gas. These collisions result in the transfer of kinetic energy from the ion (high kinetic energy) to the gas molecule (very low kinetic energy). By the time the ion exits the cell, it has considerably reduced kinetic energy and is easily filtered out by a kinetic energy barrier after the cell. See [Yamada 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sab.2015.05.008) for an extended explanation of KED processes. 

In reaction mode, a gas is used to react with either the primary ion of interest or the interferent in order to mitigate the interference. 

> Charge transfer reactions: A charge transfer reaction results in the transfer of the charge from one ion or molecule to another

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
Ammonia (NH$_{3}$) gas can be used to neutralize Hg$^{+}$ to Hg$^{0}$, thereby removing the Hg interference on Pb. This is a two step reaction that first neutralizes Hg$^{+}$ by transferring the charge to form NH$_{3}^{+}$; NH$_{3}^{+}$ then reacts with NH$_{3}$ to form NH$_{2}$ and NH$_{4}^{+}$:

$$Hg^{+} + NH_{3} = Hg^{0} + NH_{3}^{+}$$
$$NH_{3}^{+} + NH_{3} = NH_{2} + NH_{4}^{+}$$

> Atom transfer (mass shift): Atom transfer or mass shift reactions involve the creation of new molecules, effectively mass shifting an ion of interest to a new mass.

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
Polyatomic interference of $^{87}$Sr on $^{87}$Rb prevents their separation using traditional mass analyzer techniques. Within a reaction cell, the user can add SF$_6$ gas to react $^{87}$Sr$^+$ to $^{106}$SrF${^+}$. Rb is non-reactive with SF$_6$. Rb is now measured on-mass as $^{87}$Rb, whereas Sr is now measured mass-shifted as $^{106}$SrF${^+}$.

The likelihood of a reaction occurring depends upon the thermodynamics of the reaction, which is different for every element and gas. Some helpful resources for understanding reaction gas kinetics can be found below:
