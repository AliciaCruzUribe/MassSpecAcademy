My research uses stable isotopes to probe a variety of earth materials including fluids, gases, and solids. I develop new mass spectromectric methods for small samples, rare species, and new instruments and compare that to a theoretical quantum mechanical based framework. Specifically, I examine temperature change across multiple time scales from deep time to glacial cycles using novel stable isotope techniques. I have applied it to important topics such as critical minerals and mine waste as a resource, non-conventional oil and gas reserves, glaciation of Antarctica, and modern biogenic fluxes of methane to the atmosphere.
